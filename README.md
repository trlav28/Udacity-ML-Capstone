# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project
This repository is for the capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Udacity. The capstone
project consists of a PDF final report, as well as an IPYNB file that contains all of the code. In this final
project, two neural networks were built and tested on an image dataset obtained from Kaggle. The first NN was a 
pretrained ResNet model loaded from PyTorch, and the other NN was a convolutional neural net implemented from 
scratch. The ResNet model obtained 99% accuracy on the testing dataset, whereas the other ConvNet obtained
88% accuracy on the test set. 

## Python packages and Modules Needed for Project
1. os
2. numpy
3. torch
4. torchvision
5. matplotlib  
If any of these packages are not already installed, they can be installed using the conda install commands.
